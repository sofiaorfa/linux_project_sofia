Gene Name: Complement Factor H :
Information:Complement Factor H (CFH) is a key regulator of the complement system, which is part of the immune system that helps the body fight infections. Here's a brief summary:
Key Facts About Complement Factor H (CFH):
•	Gene Location: The CFH gene is located on chromosome 1 in humans.
•	Function:
o	Complement Factor H regulates the alternative pathway of the complement system, a critical part of the immune response. It helps to prevent excessive activation of this pathway, thereby protecting the body's own cells from being damaged by the immune response.
o	It binds to activated complement components (like C3b) and accelerates their decay, which prevents excessive inflammation and tissue damage.
•	Clinical Significance:
o	Mutations or deficiencies in CFH are linked to several diseases, including:
	Age-related macular degeneration (AMD): A leading cause of blindness in older adults, where inappropriate complement activation damages the retina.
	Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS): A rare kidney disease caused by uncontrolled complement activation, leading to damage of the kidneys and other organs.
	C3 glomerulopathy: A kidney disorder that involves improper complement activation in kidney tissues.
•	Protein Structure: The protein is composed of several domains that help it interact with other complement components and control their activation. Complement Factor H binds to C3b, inhibiting its action and ensuring the complement system doesn't damage the host's cells.
•	Gene Variants: Genetic variants in the CFH gene can affect its function, leading to either underactivity (which can cause immune dysregulation) or overactivity (which can cause the complement system to attack the body’s own tissues).
In Summary:
•	Complement Factor H plays an essential role in controlling the immune response by regulating the complement system, preventing it from attacking the body’s own cells. Its malfunction is linked to eye diseases and kidney disorders.
